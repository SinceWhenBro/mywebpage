			  <p>I am an aspiring software developer in Phoenix, Arizona.
        As a fashion lover and critical thinker I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class ="ul-tweak">Front-end web devlopment that focuses on UI and user appeal.</li>
          <li class ="ul-tweak">Challenging projects that genuinely teach me something</li>
          <li class ="ul-tweak">Coding at its core because of the persitence needed for it</li>

        <article>
          <p>I originally became fascinated with programming my Senior year of high school
          My first few weeks coding were agonizingly confusing and nearly forced me to give
          up altogether... but then I had my "Oh" moment. The "Oh" moment is when you finally
          figure out a program after it not making sense for what seem like forever. This is what I live for as a software devloper. Cheers to more "Oh" moments!
			    </p>
          <p>Outside of coding however, my main passions are making music, and hanging out with my friends. I think one of the most important parts of life for me isthe social aspect--I love meeting new people, and being around the one's I already do. This translates to work too, I like the idea of working as team to get to those "Oh" moments.
