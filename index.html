         <article>
            <p>I originally became fascinated with programming my Senior year of high school
            My first few weeks coding were agonizingly confusing and nearly forced me to give
            up altogether... but then I had my "Oh" moment. The "Oh" moment is when you finally
            figure out a program after it not making sense for what seem like forever. This is what I live for as a software devloper. Cheers to more "Oh" moments!
	    </p>
            <p>Outside of coding however, my main passions are making music, and hanging out with my friends. 
	     I think one of the most important parts of life for me isthe social aspect--I love meeting new people,
	     and being around the one's I already do. This translates to work too, I like the idea of working as team to get to those "Oh" moments.
